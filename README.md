## ABSTRACT
Programming language design from an educational perspective as told by Jacques Derrida, Richard Feynman, Pablo Picasso, and Carl Sagan (among others)!

The world of programming education is currently exploding. This talk will both survey the current approaches as well as take a deep dive into the approach-agnostic theoretical and pedagogical challenge of teaching programming and computer science, mainly: abstraction.  Through a multidisciplinary montage I will identify the problem of teaching abstraction as a ubiquitous demand across nearly every domain, and align the issues of creativity and critical thinking in the humanities with issues in computer science. The talk will conclude with a discussion of how the discipline of computer science and that of the humanities can inform each other to produce more effective and creative solutions to both teaching abstractions and developing abstractions.

## BIO
Ashley Williams is an Open Web Engineer and Educator at [Bocoup](http://www.bocoup.com). She also co-organizes 2 meetups: [Papers We Love, Boston](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston/) and [BostonJS](http://www.meetup.com/boston_JS/).

Formerly a [NYC Teaching Fellow](https://www.nycteachingfellows.org/), Ashley's career arc tracks from middle school science teacher to web developer. A self-taught programmer with a background in philosophy and neuroscience, she's always been an advocate of the well-rounded developer from a non-CS background. Since transitioning from public education to the world of technology, she has made it her aim to deeply interrogate how we as a community teach ourselves and the next generation of web developers. Long a critic of the armchair philosopher, Ashley has spent the vast majority of the past few years teaching beginner web developers, most notabley running the [NYC Web Development Fellowship](http://flatironschool.com/nycworkforce1/) in its flagship year.
